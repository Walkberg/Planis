score: 87
issuesSummary: |
  - Missing explicit acceptance criteria per functional requirement (FRs list present but no per-FR acceptance tests).
  - No owner/responsibility assignments for major features (who implements/accepts each FR).
  - No implementation estimates, priority (MUST/SHOULD/CAN) per FR, or dependency mapping.
  - Security and privacy controls are high-level; need threat model and data-handling checklist for import flows.
  - No API/contract placeholders for integrations (if later added) or clear storage migration plan.
recommendations: |
  1. Add concise acceptance criteria for each FR (Given/When/Then where applicable).
  2. Tag each FR with priority (MUST/SHOULD/CAN) and an owner or team responsible.
  3. Add an implementation dependencies section (libraries, 3rd-party services, permissions) and estimate effort (T-shirt or story points).
  4. Produce a short threat model for `.ics` import and sanitization steps; include test cases for malformed/malicious `.ics` entries.
  5. If you plan to add sync later, draft minimal API contract placeholders and migration strategy for local -> cloud.

checks:
  - successCriteria: present
  - userJourneys: present (4)
  - functionalRequirements: present (FR1..FR19)
  - nonFunctionalRequirements: present (performance, security, reliability, accessibility)
  - acceptanceTestsPerFR: missing
  - ownersPerFR: missing
  - estimatesPerFR: missing
  - dependencyMapping: missing
  - threatModel: missing

detailedFindings: |
  The PRD is well structured and contains the expected sections: success criteria, user journeys, FRs and NFRs, scoping and phased plan. The FRs are clear and testable at a high level, and NFRs define measurable targets (import time, responsiveness, WCAG AA). However, for implementation readiness the document lacks per-FR acceptance criteria, explicit owners/assignees, priority markings, and basic implementation estimates. These gaps reduce handoff quality for engineering and make planning sprints harder.

readiness: |
  The document is ready for an initial implementation sprint with minor additions. Score 87/100: "pass with issues" — address the recommendations to reach "ready for Q/A and sprint planning".

## PRD Validation Report — Planis

**Validated at:** 2026-02-03T12:10:00Z
**Validator:** bmad-analyst
**Status:** pass-with-issues
**Score:** 87/100

Summary:

- The PRD contains all major required sections and a usable set of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.
- Missing items are primarily about implementation readiness (acceptance tests, owners, estimates, dependencies, threat model).

Actionable next steps:

1. Add per-FR acceptance criteria (one-liners or Gherkin where helpful).
2. Add priority tags and owners for each FR.
3. Add a short dependencies list and light effort estimates for MVP scope.
4. Create a short threat model and test cases for `.ics` import sanitization.
5. Re-run validation after updates to move score toward 95+.
